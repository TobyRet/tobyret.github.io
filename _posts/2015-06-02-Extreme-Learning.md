Last weekend I was lucky enough to attend [Socrates UK 2014](http://socratesuk.org), an annual international software craftsmanship gathering set in the scenic surroundings of Farnham, Oxfordshire. If you have not done so, I defintely recommend checkout out this conference, either in England or the other Socrates events taking place across Europe (Germany, Belgium, France ...). 

At the time of writing this post I am a software apprentice at [Codurance](http://www.codurance.com). My <strong>'things to learn'</strong> pile seems to get bigger all the time. Java fundamentals, SOLID princples, TDD practices, oh wait … Some of the developers at the project I am working on are now using <em>Scala</em>. I need to at least be able to understand their code. Hang on, <em>Terraform</em> has been coming up in a number of discussions - need to get my head around that … you get the idea right?

Given the volume of learning required, and having limited time available to do it, I was really grateful to the crew at 8th Light, who at Socrates UK 2015, lead an awesome workshop on <strong>Extreme Learning</strong>.

So if you are like me and want to make your learning process more efficient, have a shot at this. This method is adapted from 8th Light's workshop with my own additions.

##Extreme Leaning 101

###Define your learning objective
Borrowing form Behaviour Driven Design will help you here. For example:

As a [<em>Apprentice? Experienced developer? Scrum Master?</em>]<br>
I want to [<em>Learn Scala? Learn the Adapter Pattern?</em>]<br>
So that I can [<em>Define your outcome here</em>]<br>

###Timebox your efforts
Give yourself 30 minutes to learn everything you can about the subject you have chosen. Bear in mind, attempting to learn a language in 30 minutes is perhaps asking for a little too much so, if your learning objective is substantial break it down into smaller increments. Rather than learn a whole language in 30 minutes, instead narrow the scope of your learning objective - perhaps get to grips with a library, API or perhaps a few select ethods.

<strong>How does timeboxing help?</strong> If you are time-poor, thirty minutes is a more do-able timeframe  and you are more likely to find 30 minutes during your day than an hour or more (e.g. during your lunch break, before or after work). Remember also, that the key to Extreme Learning is quality of learning, not quantity. 30 mins of intense, uninterrupted high quality study is far better than 1 hour of unfocused, interupted study - how many times do you catch yourself switching off an alternating between checking your emails? Thirty minutes is not a long time, so if you set a timer, the pressure and ticking clock will help you perform that much better.

###Have something to show for it
The time you spend needs to result in some sort of output. At the workshop, the 8th light guys had us do a lightning talk to he group. This could be great in a work situation - perhaps you can do something with work colleagues over a lunch break. If you are going solo, then a good alternative is to create a blog based on your findings. 

<strong>How does creating an output help?</strong> I can’t stress enough this aspect enough. Presenting a talk, a demo or a blog will allow you to verbalising your thought processes, help you retain information, and perhaps give some much needed advice to out other developers out there. The act of creating an output is advice regulalry seen in a lot of self help and tech books out there (e.g [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) and the idea of a <strong>minimum viable product</strong>). The key is not to get too fixated on creating the perfect blog or presentation. Just get something out there, <strong>get feedback</strong> and improve it if necessary. Keep creating outputs in this way and you will find you will improve over time.
