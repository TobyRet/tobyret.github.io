Last weekend I was lucky enough to attend [Socrates UK 2014](http://socratesuk.org), an annual international software craftsmanship gathering set well beyond the reach of the big smoke, in Farnham, Oxfordshire. If you have not done so, I defintely recommend checkout out this conference, either in England or the other Socrates events taking place across Europe.

As an software apprentice at [Codurance](http://www.codurance.com), my <strong>'things to learn'</strong> pile seems to get bigger all the time. Java fundamentals, SOLID princples, TDD practices, oh wait … Some of the developers at the project I am working on are now using Scala. I need to at least be able to understand their code. Hang on, Terraform has been coming up in a number of discussions - need to get my head around that … you get the idea right?

Given the volume of learning required, and having limited time available to do it, I was really grateful to the crew at 8th Light, who at Socrates UK 2015, lead an awesome workshop on Extreme Learning.

So if you are like me and want to make your learning process more efficient, have a shot at this.

###1. Define your learning objective
Some BDD thinking will help here. For example:

As a [Apprentice? Experienced developer? Scrum Master?] 
I want to [Learn Scala? Learn the Adapter Pattern?]
So that I can [Define your outcome here]

###2. Timebox your efforts
Give yourself 30 minutes to learn everything you can about something. E.g. a design pattern. 
Obviously trying to learn a language in 30 minutes is perhaps asking for a little to much so, if your learning objective is substantial break it down into smaller increments. Rather than learn a whole language in 30 minutes, instead narrow the scope to a library, API or perhaps a few methods.

###3. Have something to show for it
The time you spend needs to result in some sort of output. At the workshop, the 8th light guys had us do a lightning talk to he group. This could be great in a work situation - perhaps you can do something with work colleagues. If you are going solo, then perhaps your output could be a blog. Blogging will help verbalise your thoughts, help you retain information, and perhaps help out other people out there.

###Why does this work?
For the the busy, a thirty minute timeframe is more doable timeframe (e.g. during your lunch break, before or after work). Some people can find the time to run marathon a couple of times per week, but for most, a 30 min run is more likely scenario.

30 mins of intense, uninterrupted high quality study is better than 1 hour of average study, alternating between checking your smart phone for messages. Thirty minutes aint a long time, so if you know the clock is ticking down, the pressure will help you perform that much better.

I can’t stress enough about Having an output, or something to demo. This is a common practice in a lot of self-help books -
