## Orientation, getting to grips with the basics & crotch blow-out...

Hey everyone.

Week one is complete!

It's Saturday afternoon as I write this and I never been happier to sit on the couch!  My mind is buzzing, and at the same time, I'm feeling pretty tired. My first week at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) has been a good one and I'd thought I'd share some of the highlights...

## Orientation
The February cohort of Makers Academy is made up of 22 students, a number of whom have travelled a long way to be here. One guy even crowd-funded his way onto the course. From what I can make out so far, there is a real mix in terms of backgrounds - some are straight out of Uni, others are career-switching. Our introduction to Makers Academy kicked off with some really useful advice from the teaching team. Having now graduated 100+ students they are at a point where they have some strong theories about how new students can make the most of their time during the twelve weeks. Quite simply, the most successful graduates:1) **Worked hard**. We should expect to do an additional 2-3 hours per day of study outside of class and...2) **Were confident**. Self-belief plays an important role. > 'Whether you think you can, or you think you can't - you're right.' Henry FordThese points have really struck a chord with me. Not once was it claimed that a background in computer science and a high IQ were essential prerequisites. Rather, the Makers Academy crew are keen to emphasise that it's more about a willingness to learn and adopting an [internal locus of control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control). This attidude no doubt has relevance in all aspects of life, and is not just soley relevant to learning software development.We were warned that it's normal to go through a bit of a 'slump' half way through the course as the intensity picks up. Openly crying at your desk has is normal, apparently!![](/content/images/2014/Feb/crying_cat_nb6376.jpg)

## The learning beginsWe were all armed with a MacBook Pro and desk space and hit the books...or in this case, the online course materials. Learning to code is going to take a lot of mental energy and so I'm particularly pleased that we have unlimited access to snacks and drinks (including beer!) from the well-supplied kitchen.Topics covered this week were [command line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), [version control](https://github.com/tretallick) and [ruby language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) basics culminating in our [first project](https://github.com/tretallick/student-directory). There is a mix of lectures and self-directed learning, but the big emphasis is on peer learning and ultimately, peer programming. Peer programming (pairing with another person to code) is seen as a sure-fire way to quickly build programming skills and create good software. This point was emphasised by our first guest speaker [Sam Joseph](http://www.hpu.edu/CNCS/Faculty_Staff/CV/SamJoseph%20.html) from Hawai'i Pacific University. Pair programming, in his opinion is a multiplier in terms of skills development. **Start it early and do it often**. His advice to would-be programmers again echoes Makers Academy's own regarding *confidence* - the open source community is very welcoming and we should just get in there asap and start contributing. ![](/content/images/2014/Feb/sam_joseph-1.jpg)

## Health mind, healthy body...
But mind your jeans.Makers Academy has its very own '*Chief of Joy*'.  Dana is there to look out for the well-being of students and as part of her role she holds daily meditation sessions. Feeling like I could do with a bit of time-out from coding, I went along happily to give it a go. I soon realised that my slim-fitting jeans were not cut out for sitting cross-legged (or even kneeling) on a mat. I spent those ten precious minutes worrying about a pending crotch blowout, rather than emptying my head of all thoughts. That said, I really appreciated the opportunity, and will continue to take up the offer, perhaps next time sporting a pair of jeggings.![](/content/images/2014/Feb/blowout4.jpg)

## The first test
The week ended with with a test on the command line. I went into it feeling prepared but quite nervous all the same. The test was challenging and a number of the questions were new territory, requiring some frantic googling. Pleased to say I passed though and now am the proud owner of the Unixoid sticker below. Hooray :-)Bring on week 2.![](/content/images/2014/Feb/unixoid_final.jpg)",
