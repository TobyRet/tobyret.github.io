Between 2007 and 2014 I worked client-side in marketing and digital roles and volunteered as a digital consultant for an environmental agency. I oversaw the creation of some cool digital products but found this to be less satisfying over time as I was not the one making them.

In 2014 I turned my programming hobby into a new career. After graduating from [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) I joined the team at [Codurance](http://www.codurance.com) as one of their first Software Craftsman Apprentices, graduating as Software Craftsman in July 2016.

To date my clients have included [Amazon Web Services](http://awsloft.london), [Crowdmix](http://www.crowdmix.me) & [Coniq](www.coniq.com). 

Currently I am helping [Merger Market](http://www.mergermarket.com) develop their flagship financial news product, Debtwire. 

Every project I have helped out on has required me to get to grips with new tech stacks ... Java, Ruby, Javascript, Clojure, front end, back end, functional style, OO style, SQL, NO-SQL  ... You name it. 

I love a new challenge. Rather than being too hung up on certain tech or approaches, I prefer to have a range of tools at my disposal in order make the best possible software for the client.  

On the side, I attend London Software Craftmanship Community and functional programming meetups, volunteer my services to a local school (to help maintain their website), play with [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and practice karate.
