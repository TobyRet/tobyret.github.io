Between 2007 and 2014 I worked client-side in marketing and digital roles and volunteered as a digital consultant for an environmental agency. I oversaw the creation of some cool digital products but found this to be less satisfying over time as I was not the one making them.

In 2014 I turned my programming hobby into a new career. After graduating from [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) I joined the team at [Codurance](http://www.codurance.com) as one of their first Software Developer Apprentices. 

I'm currently part of the developer team helping to build [Crowdmix](http://www.crowdmix.me).
